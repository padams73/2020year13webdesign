         <p>We are a small start up company that specialises in selling lights for skateboards. Our lights are designed to be low profile and discrete so that the rider is able to get aorund with no extra bulk that other lights come with. Our products encourage a safe and sustainable form of transport, skating. With the world ever evolving sustainable transport is becoming more popular by the year and more people are taking to riding bikes or electric vehicles rather than personal cars or public transport, and of course for some people this method of transport is skating. </p>

         <p>As a company we are innovating with our product. Our product is a riser with lights built in which is something no other company is selling; we did this so that the lights are low profile and doesn’t take away from the aesthetic of a skateboard.</p>
