<h3>About Nicholas Clapp</h3>
<p class="text-md-left">Nick Clapp is a Councillor based in the area of Ladbrooks, where he has lived for many years. Nick Clapp is good for you and I'm here to tell you why. Nick Clapp brings experience from the private sector for a high quality firm, and then set up a medical practice called The Clapp Treatment, providing doctoral services to the community. Nick Clapp also travelled to South Africa where he funded a piece of wood to help start a fire, and then went to England where he used his sense of genorosity by giving 4 cans of Baked Beans to the homeless. Whilst very charitable, Clapp has an eye for business. He has been involved in 10 business deals, and whilst only 2 are still operational, Clapp's experience is second to none. He runs a Insurance Company called ClappClaims, which he and his staff pride themselves of their rule of thumb of denying every claim. Unfortunately, this firm gets into a large amount of Legal Trouble however since Clapp runs a law firm, they always come out unstuck. Nick Clapp is the voice we need. </p>
