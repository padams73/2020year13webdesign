<p>To access all HELP from this website, you need an account. You will
need your email address and username. There are no spams in this
website. You will also need to create a password. It is recommended
you pick an easy-to-remember password but not too easy for password
hackers to guess correctly. It is recommended you pick both words and
numbers. You will need to write your password twice to make sure
there have not been any typos, so don't just copy and paste. Once you
have confirmed, you will be taken to your own personal home page
where you can access the HELP you need for your maths work.</p><!--This paragraph appears as text on the website.-->
